# OPERATIONALIZING ML FOR BANKING DATASET

Azure was used to configure a cloud-based machine learning model using the bank marketing dataset. The main goal is to predict if a client will accept to subscribe to the bank's term deposit. The best model is attained using automl, deployed and the model endpoints consumed. Also the python sdk is used to create, publish and consume a pipeline.
